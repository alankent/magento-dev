# Provider: magento-cloud

This provider is a simple example for Magento Cloud integration. Currently it just
echos the commands for the user to use. For example, code deployments are done via
git. Rather than run git add/commit/push etc, this is left to the responsibility of
the user. (This might change in the future to run the real commands.)
